This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## E Commarce Front part
#### This is a note for myself how to run this project

Step 1: Open This Repository Along With admin Repository in a VS code Shared workspace
        and Run on both terminal
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```
Step 2: Open MongoDB Compass and Connect to my MongoDB Atlas Cluster with my URI with password
Step 3: Go to >> C:\Program Files (x86)\Stripe
    and Run
    ```
    stripe.exe
    ```
Step 4: Need to Check Stripe status to Confirm if webhook is working for localhost
    Run
    ```
    stripe status
    ```
Step-5: As Stripe CLI is running on Local Environment to check the Webhook this command
    
    ```bash
    stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3001/api/webhook
    ```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
